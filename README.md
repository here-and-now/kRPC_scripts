# Scripts and more for Kerbal Space Program.
## Mod List
#### Utility
  *   [krpc](https://github.com/krpc/krpc) - kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from scripts running outside of the game, and comes with client libraries for many popular languages.
  * [MechJeb2](https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2) - Anatid Robotics and Multiversal Mechatronics proudly presents the first flight assistant autopilot: MechJeb
  
#### Gameplay
  * [Kerbalism](https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism) - Kerbalism is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that alters the game to add life support, radiation, ISRU chains, part and engine failures and an entirely new way of doing science.  
  * [RemoteTech](https://github.com/RemoteTechnologiesGroup/RemoteTech) - RemoteTech allows you to construct vast relay networks of communication satellites and remotely-controlled unmanned vehicles. Your unmanned vessels require an uplink to a command station to be controlled. This adds a new layer of difficulty that compensates for the lack of live crew members. 
  * [Outer-Planets-Mod](https://github.com/Poodmund/Outer-Planets-Mod) - The Outer Planets Mod is a mod that expands the outer edges of the Kerbol system to create something akin to the real Solar System's. It adds Kerbalized versions of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto as well as several of these planets' moons.    
  * [CommunityTechTree](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/CommunityTechTree)  
  * [FAR](https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research) - Aerodynamics model
* [DeadlyReentry](https://github.com/Starwaster/DeadlyReentry) - Heat and force damage for KSP
* 
#### Parts
* [ProceduralParts](https://github.com/KSP-RO/ProceduralParts) - ProceduralParts allows you to procedurally generate a number of different parts in a range of sizes and shapes. The parts are fully tweakable with multiple options for customization of the shape, surface texture, and other parameters.
* [ProceduralFairings](https://github.com/KSP-RO/ProceduralFairings) - Procedural Fairings is a mod for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) that creates fairings that can automatically reshape for any attached payload.
