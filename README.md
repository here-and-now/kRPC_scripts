## Mod List

  *   [krpc](https://github.com/krpc/krpc) - kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from scripts running outside of the game, and comes with client libraries for many popular languages.
  
  * [Kerbalism](https://github.com/Kerbalism/Kerbalism) - Kerbalism is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that alters the game to add life support, radiation, ISRU chains, part and engine failures and an entirely new way of doing science.
